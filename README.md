AndroidProgramming
==================

This program was created as a student project for JAMK's Mobile programming with android course, by Antti Minkkinen & James Pearce
The goal of the project was to make prototype application that uses a database to store prices of products and then
can be used to search for shops that sells the product in question. The applications can also add and change products and product prices in the database

Installation
============

It is not planned to have the prototype in mass use and thus does not need installation guides.

Requirements
============

Target API Level is 21
Minimum API level is 16

User guide
==========

The user interface is rather simple having only a few buttons that are well labelled and the editable text areas have hints to guide how to use them.

Future development
==================

Currently we have no known bugs and neither of us have any plans to develop this further.
The main problems for future development will be user handling, how to prevent the user from uploading wrong prices or useless photos.
